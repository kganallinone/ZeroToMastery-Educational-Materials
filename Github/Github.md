## 1. Check for Unused Dependencies

Before removing dependencies, you need to identify which ones are no longer in use.

### Tools to Identify Unused Dependencies

- **npm-check**: A tool that helps you check for outdated, unused, or missing dependencies.
- **depcheck**: This tool specifically checks for unused dependencies and devDependencies.

#### Installing and Using `npm-check`

To install and run `npm-check`, use the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g npm-check
npm-check
```

This command will list all your dependencies, highlighting any that are unused.

#### Installing and Using `depcheck`

To install and run `depcheck`, use these commands:

```bash
npm install -g depcheck
depcheck
```

This will output a list of unused dependencies in your project.

## 2. Remove Unused Dependencies

Once youâ€™ve identified the unused dependencies, you can remove them.

### Removing a Specific Package

To uninstall a specific package, use the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

For `yarn` users, the command is:

```bash
yarn remove <package-name>
```

### Removing All Unused Dependencies (with `npm-check`)

If you use `npm-check`, it allows you to remove unused dependencies interactively. After running the following command, you can select which dependencies you want to remove:

```bash
npm-check --update
```

## 3. Double-check `package.json`

After removing dependencies, make sure that your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files are updated correctly to reflect these changes.

## Conclusion

Regularly checking for and removing unused dependencies helps keep your project clean and efficient. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can maintain a lean dependency list and improve your project's performance.
